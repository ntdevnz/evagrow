## Project Overview
-----
Evagrow is an innovative open-source hardware project that aims to provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution for indoor gardening. The project is focused on designing a flat-pack, modular, and easy-to-assemble hydroponic unit that can be built using CNC laser cutting and routing technology. The project offers two different sized units, each designed for different applications, such as home gardening, small-scale commercial cultivation, or educational purposes. The units are stackable up to three units high, allowing for flexibility and scalability depending on the user's needs.

The project provides all the necessary drawing files and DXFs for building your own unit, including detailed instructions and assembly guides. The project also includes BOMs (Bill of Materials) and affiliate links to known suppliers in certain countries and regions, making it easier for people to source the required materials. The project is designed to be affordable and accessible to anyone, regardless of their skill level or location.

The project is supported by affiliate marketing, Patreon, and crypto donations, which will be used to help run and maintain the project. These funds will be used to cover the costs of hosting, development, and maintenance of the project, as well as to support future development and expansion of the project.

Overall, Evagrow is an ambitious project that aims to make indoor gardening more accessible, sustainable, and affordable for everyone. By providing an easy-to-use and modular hydroponic unit, the project hopes to inspire more people to grow their own food and to promote the benefits of sustainable indoor gardening.


##Contribue
------
We welcome contributions to the Evagrow project from the community. If you are interested in contributing, you can make git commits to the project through the use of pull requests. We encourage the creation of branches for different types of designs and forking from the project, this allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives to be brought to the table. Features and ideas that will improve the main branch will be commited to Main by the project administrators.

We will be moving the project to FreeCAD, which is a free and open-source CAD software, so that everyone will have access to the design files. This will ensure that anyone can participate in the development and improvement of the project, regardless of their access to proprietary software.
At present all project files are in Soldiworks and Fusion 360.
DXFs of profile cutting, laser cutting and cut and fold instructions are included in the project.
