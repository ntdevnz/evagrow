##Flat Pack hydroponic System
-----

The Evagrow project is motivated by the belief that everyone should have the right to grow their own food and plants, regardless of their living conditions or access to land. With the effects of global warming becoming increasingly apparent, it is more important than ever to find sustainable and efficient ways to grow food indoors. Hydroponics is a highly effective method of indoor gardening, but it has traditionally been expensive and difficult for the average person to set up and maintain.

The Evagrow project aims to change that by providing an easy-to-use, flat-pack, and modular hydroponic unit that can be built using CNC laser cutting and routing technology. The units are designed to be stackable, allowing for scalability depending on the user's needs.

With the increasing trend of apartment living, many people are finding themselves without access to outdoor gardening space. Evagrow aims to make indoor gardening a viable alternative, giving people the ability to grow fresh, healthy food in their own homes. Additionally, many people lack the resources or knowledge to set up and maintain a hydroponic system, the project is designed to be accessible to anyone, regardless of their skill level or location.

The Evagrow project is dedicated to the idea that everyone should have the right to grow their own food and plants, and we hope to make that a reality for as many people as possible.





##Project Overview
-----
Evagrow is an innovative open-source hardware project that aims to provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution for indoor gardening. The project is focused on designing a flat-pack, modular, and easy-to-assemble hydroponic unit that can be built using CNC laser cutting and routing technology. The project offers two different sized units, each designed for different applications, such as home gardening, small-scale commercial cultivation, or educational purposes. The units are stackable up to three units high, allowing for flexibility and scalability depending on the user's needs.

The project provides all the necessary drawing files and DXFs for building your own unit, including detailed instructions and assembly guides. The project also includes BOMs (Bill of Materials) and affiliate links to known suppliers in certain countries and regions, making it easier for people to source the required materials. The project is designed to be affordable and accessible to anyone, regardless of their skill level or location.

The project is supported by affiliate marketing, Patreon, and crypto donations, which will be used to help run and maintain the project. These funds will be used to cover the costs of hosting, development, and maintenance of the project, as well as to support future development and expansion of the project.

Overall, Evagrow is an ambitious project that aims to make indoor gardening more accessible, sustainable, and affordable for everyone. By providing an easy-to-use and modular hydroponic unit, the project hopes to inspire more people to grow their own food and to promote the benefits of sustainable indoor gardening.





##Contribue
------
We welcome contributions to the Evagrow project from the community. If you are interested in contributing, you can make git commits to the project through the use of pull requests. We encourage the creation of branches for different types of designs and forking from the project, this allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives to be brought to the table. Features and ideas that will improve the main branch will be commited to Main by the project administrators.

We will be moving the project to FreeCAD, which is a free and open-source CAD software, so that everyone will have access to the design files. This will ensure that anyone can participate in the development and improvement of the project, regardless of their access to proprietary software.
At present all project files are in Soldiworks and Fusion 360.
DXFs of profile cutting, laser cutting and cut and fold instructions are included in the project.

-3d Design files currently for both models in Fusion 360 and Solidworks.

-Freecad files: The project is moving to FreeCAD, which is a free and open-source CAD software, so that everyone will have access to the design files.

-Creative Commons licensing: The project is released under the Creative Commons license structure, which allows for the free use, distribution, and modification of the project's files.

-Volumetric.co.nz engineering company: Evagrow is based on the design ideas from Volumetric.co.nz, an engineering company with 15 years of experience in the manufacturing space.




##Getting Started
-----

Welcome to the Evagrow project, an open-source hydroponic unit that is easy to assemble and customize to suit your needs. We are excited to share our design with you and encourage you to contribute to the project.

To get started with building your own Evagrow unit, there are a few options available.

Kitparts: Kitparts will soon be available for purchase from evagrow.co.nz, which includes all the necessary parts and hardware to assemble your unit.

DIY Option: If you prefer to do everything yourself, you can download the design files from the GitHub repository. The files include CAD drawings and DXF files, which can be used with a variety of software such as FreeCAD, Solidworks, and Fusion 360.

Review the Design: Before building your unit, it's important to review the design and get an understanding of all the components. This will help you plan your build and ensure that you have all the necessary parts and tools.

Build Instructions: Detailed build instructions are provided with the design files, making it easy for anyone to assemble the unit.

BOM: A bill of materials (BOM) is also provided, which includes a list of all the components required for the build, including the LED strips and electrical components.

Light Components: The light components consist of the clear cover cut from 1mm acrylic and the panel made from laser-cut and folded aluminum panels. Standard furniture fixings are used to hold the shelves together.

Shelving: The shelving is router cut from one side of a sheet of furniture plywood, which makes for an easy and efficient build.

Please note that the design is modular and stackable up to 3 units high, and that the project is moving to freecad
